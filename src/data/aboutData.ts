    "As a Mechanical Engineer specializing in HVAC, firefighting, plumbing, and infrastructure systems, I bring frontline experience in executing complex MEP works that meet the highest global standards. From concept to commissioning, I lead with precision, safety, and technical excellence—ensuring every system I work on performs reliably and efficiently.",
    "I am highly proficient in interpreting and applying international codes including ASHRAE, SMACNA, NFPA 13/14/20/25, IPC, UPC, IMC, IBC, SBC, SCDB, ASPE, ASME, AWS, OSHA, ISO 45001, NEC, IEC, IEEE, SAES and British Standards (BS 9999, BS EN 12845). My approach is built on delivering practical, compliant, and high-efficiency systems across diverse environments—whether it's multi-building university housing or mission-critical cooling plants.",
    "My expertise spans full lifecycle MEP execution: design reviews, shop drawings, procurement, site supervision, testing & commissioning, QA/QC, and seamless project handover. I’m known for solving problems where accuracy and pressure intersect—managing installations under tight timelines while upholding safety and engineering integrity."
